Everything must eventually come to an end. But some ends come more quickly than others. If you catch up with one participant of our fist surfcamp, we’re pretty sure they will endorse this claim. Last week they were struggling with the waves. Today, the situation is the opposite. The waves were not plenty enough to feed our 20 hungry surfers devs.

With another 5 surfing lessons under the belt plus 3 more free surf sessions, the level went through the roof. The two surf monitors, Mickael and François from Authentic Surf School, gave some precious advices and finally the magic happened. Everybody took off and started to explore the deep water enjoying a serious push in the swell (from 2 feet to 6+). This went medieval but the friendships freshly born do not suffered from a couple of wild boards flying here and there.

On the other hand, life kept the same pace at the camp. We were trying to focus on the coding lessons when our bodies were begging for some rest. But mission accomplished : http, CRUD, rails, ajax, heroku and bootstrap have been scrutinized and worked their magic plenty. Even the dog sneaked-in a presentation or two after its daily hedgehog hunt.

Well decided to push our limit further, we managed to dive deep into the local establishment having some drinks at La Centrale, Hossegor. The folks were kind and the mid 90’s songs enhanced everybody. At the end nobody got hurt (which could have happened regarding some weird dancing move performed at the occasion).
